# Grappel CLI
### This CLI tool was created as a learning project to understand the basics of creating CLIs in Java using the Picocli framework.

### Usage:
#### 1. Search the total occurrences of a specific word / text in a single file or recursively through an entire project. 
#### 2. Count the contents of a file (Additional features will be added later depending on the amount of time I am willing to invest in this project in the future):
#### a) Line:- Count the total lines of text or code in a single file or recursively through an entire project.
